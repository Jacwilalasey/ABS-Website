                        ABS was formed in 1993 to provide the “supply chain underdogs” with the same high standard of service that main contractor’s and client’s are more accustomed to. By balancing the playing field ABS has been able to secure excellent outcomes for our clients, both domestic and abroad, with respect to construction claims and disputes that have arisen during the course of their project delivery. <BR></BR>

                        Our primary aim at ABS is to avoid disputes arising and securing payments using sound contractual and commercial advice. We can work with clients from the outset of the project to enable the most commercially and contractually favourable terms and conditions to be agreed, which should facilitate favourable outcomes throughout project delivery.
